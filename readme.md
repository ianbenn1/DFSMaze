DFS Maze solver
---------------------
The user can create the size and blocked section of the maze using the
controls on the top of the page, and choose the way that the algorithm
attempts to solve the page.

The maze solving uses a depth first search style to proceed until it's
blocked, when it then backtracks previously vised locations until it
finds one it can continue from.
